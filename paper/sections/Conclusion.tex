\section{Conclusion}
This paper shows how OO programming improves the modularity of shallow EDSLs.
With the procedural abstraction mechanisms provided by OO languages, various types of
interpretations can be defined modularly. We also show that defining
transformations in shallow embeddings is possible.

There are still certain interpretations that can not be modeled modularly,
including transformations and binary methods.
For transformations, we have to refine their return type in extensions and
supply a new implementation by duplicating the original code.
For binary methods like equality, there is no way to refine the argument type.
How to define these methods modularly is a possible line of future work.
Also, it is still tedious to express the inheritance relationships in extensions,
especially when multiple inheritance is used. Another line of future work is to
use some meta-programming mechanisms to eliminate these boilerplate.
